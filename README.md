# pong2.0

This is the second version of my pingPong app - now using Node, React, Express, and MySql.

This time, the goal is to understand how all the pieces of the stack fit together, as opposed to using the auto-generate features within Visual Studio/.NET.

When it is finished, it will be deployed locally on an old Linux laptop at the IQ office to track game statistics and betting ledgers.
